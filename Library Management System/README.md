# Library Management System

## Applications needed to run this system

The following features or software are needed to run this application:

- Python
- Flask
- MySQL

Pip, which is frequently used to install Python packages, was used to install this software and packages. The code can be accessed using the web browser at "http://localhost:5000/" and is intended to run locally. It would need to be installed on a web server that is reachable via a public IP address or domain name in order to be made available to others.

We also used Docker, and DataGrip. Docker can be used to containerize the application and make it more portable across different environments, while DataGrip is an IDE for database development and management that can be used to manage the database for the application.

## Front end HTML

This web page can be used to keep track of books in a library system. Once the server has been established successfully and the URL has been entered, a login screen will appear . You may log in by entering your credentials. By selecting the "Create Account" an individual can create an account in the system.

You will be taken to the main page after logging in, where you may search for a book by author name or title. You can also check out a book of your choosing.

An admin has the ability to add a book, by clicking the "Add Book" button and fill out the blanks: book's title and author name. Then, to store this information, they would then click the "Add Book" option.

Enter the book's title in the "Delete Book" section then click the "Delete" button to remove the book from your library. If the book already exists, the application will remove it from the library system.
